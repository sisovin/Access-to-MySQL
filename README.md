## 🗺️ Roadmap

Our mission: **Create a modern web application for migrating Access databases to MySQL, featuring a sleek interface for browsing, previewing, and managing the transfer process with real-time feedback.**

**Component Breakdown:**

1. **src/index.css**  
   _Foundation for the global design system, including font imports, color tokens, and resets._

2. **tailwind.config.ts**  
   _Custom Tailwind theme with gradients, blue-green palette, and shadow utilities._

3. **src/components/DatabaseSelector.tsx**  
   _Simulated file browser for selecting Access databases. Includes drag-and-drop, validation, and recent files list._

4. **src/components/DatabasePreview.tsx**  
   _Tabbed preview of database objects (tables, queries, procedures), record counts, and selective migration toggles._

5. **src/components/TransferProgress.tsx**  
   _Animated, step-by-step progress bar with per-table tracking, error handling, and live updates._

6. **src/components/MySQLConfiguration.tsx**  
   _Form for entering and testing MySQL connection settings. Includes smart validation and feedback._

7. **src/pages/Index.tsx**  
   _Orchestrates the 5-step migration wizard:  
   1. Select Access file  
   2. Configure MySQL  
   3. Preview data  
   4. Confirm & Transfer  
   5. Completion summary_

8. **src/App.css**  
   _Overrides for Tailwind and custom animations. Smooth transitions for modals, cards, and progress bars._

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works

1. **Select Access Database:**  
   Use the file browser to upload or select an Access `.mdb` / `.accdb` file.

2. **Configure MySQL:**  
   Enter MySQL connection details. Test the connection before proceeding.

3. **Preview Database:**  
   Inspect tables, queries, and procedures. Choose what to include in the migration.

4. **Migrate with Real-Time Progress:**  
   Start the migration. Watch the animated progress bar update for each object transferred. Receive toast notifications for successes or errors.

5. **Review Summary:**  
   Get a full summary of the migration, including any issues or skipped items.

## 🏗️ Extending, Refining, & Customizing

- **Visual Tweaks:** Easily refine design, transitions, and layout in `index.css`, `App.css`, or via Tailwind config.
- **Prompt-Driven Edits:** Use "chat mode" for planning or refining features without code changes.
- **GitHub Sync:** Integrate with GitHub for version control and two-way sync.
- **Add Features with Supabase:** Want to add user accounts, save migration history, or connect to cloud services? Supabase provides simple, scalable backend solutions.
